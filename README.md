Motion tracking algorithms are widely used in computer vision related research. 
However, the new video standards, especially those in high resolutions, cause that current implementations, even running on modern hardware, no longer meet the needs of real-time processing. 
To overcome this challenge several  parallel and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) computing approaches have recently been proposed. 
In this work, we propose a development scheme enabling an efficient exploitation of GPUs, in order to achieve real-time processing of videos. 
Based on this scheme, we developed GPU implementations of several methods related to motion tracking such as silhouette extraction, corners detection and tracking using optical flow estimation. 
The parallel real time algorithm of segmentation, tracking and recognition of objects on video sequences is presented.
